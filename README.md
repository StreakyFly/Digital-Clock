# Digital Clock
A simple Digital Clock app for Windows that I made in a few hours as my second C# project.  

For the base of the app I followed a tutorial by CodAffection: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1vEqRkx700  
Designing the background in Photoshop probably took me longer than actually coding.
